Age Calculator (Python)
This is a simple Python program that calculates your age based on your birth year.

ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. The program asks you to enter your birth year.

2. It uses Python's datetime module to get the current year.

3. It subtracts your birth year from the current year to calculate your age.

4. Finally, it displays your age in years.

Example:
Enter your birth year: 2009  
You are 16 years old.
(The output will vary depending on the current year.)

How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Save the code in a file, e.g., age_calculator.py.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the script:


Requirements:
1. Python 3.x

Notes:
This is a basic age calculator. It doesnâ€™t consider the birth month and day, so the exact age may vary depending on whether your birthday has occurred this year or not.
